# a-game-of-chance

A Game of Chance is a web app developed for the purpose of helping folks with long lists of yet-to-be-played video games, referred to colloquially as "backlogs", and experiencing decision paralysis due to the vastness of the aforementioned lists, approach them in the most succinct and neutral method possible: randomization! Clicking the big "Choose a game to play!" on the page will select a game entirely at random; never again will you be left overthinking how best to waste your own free time!

3. Build with `npm run build` or `yarn run build`
